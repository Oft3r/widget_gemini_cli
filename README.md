# 📟 Gemini CLI Widget for Android

## 🌟 Overview
**Gemini CLI Widget** is a stylish home screen shortcut for developers and terminal enthusiasts. It provides a beautiful, terminal-inspired (CLI) interface that acts as a **vibrant direct access point** to the official Google Gemini app on Android.

## 🚀 Purpose
This project is dedicated to developers who love the terminal aesthetic and want a more personalized, "hacker-style" way to launch Gemini from their home screen. 

> **Note**: This widget functions primarily as a **visual shortcut**. Tapping it will launch the Google Gemini application, providing a seamless transition from your custom terminal look to the full power of the Gemini AI.

## ✨ Key Features
- **Visual Direct Access**: A much more aesthetic alternative to the standard app icon.
- **Terminal Aesthetic**: Deep dark mode (`#121212`), rounded corners, and authentic monospace typography.
- **Iconic ASCII Branding**: Character-by-character native gradient rendering (Blue to Pink) for the Gemini logo.
- **"Fake" CLI Interface**: Displays a static terminal environment with tips and a simulated command prompt, making your home screen look like a real dev environment.

## 🛠️ Technical Details
- **Framework**: [Flutter](https://flutter.dev)
- **Native Shortcut**: Uses `home_widget` to handle the intent that triggers the Google Gemini app.
- **Optimized for Android**: Designed to fit perfectly in modern launchers.

## 📦 How to Use
1. **Build and Install**: Run `flutter build apk --release` and install on your Android device.
2. **Open the App**: Launch it once to ensure the widget systems are initialized.
3. **Add Widget**:
   - Long press your home screen.
